2. **Frontend**: Built with React and TypeScript, it provides the user interface for the application.
3. **Python Interface**: A desktop application for microphone selection, MP3 uploads, and song management.

### Next Steps
1. Decide if the `api` folder in the backend will be used. If not, you can delete it.
2. Replace `<repository-url>` in the `README.md` with the actual repository URL.
3. Let me know if you need help with any additional features or instructions!---
